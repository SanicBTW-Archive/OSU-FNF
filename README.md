Dunno what this is but another project of FNF lol

now works with html5

this gets songs from a pocketbase server collection i made with some fnf songs, after some time digging up with lime future and that shit i got this to work with html5

note: preloading is on but there is not that much to preload so everything is safe

note 2: idk if it will work on gh pages, https and http are not really friends when it comes to requests

name of the repo could change or something but this has nothing to do with osu, i wanted to make it more osu like, setting middlescroll changing ui, changing the hud elements and that shit but im currently focusing some other stuff

# this uses an old version fnf pe 0.3.2h probably one of the first commits, still playable though
